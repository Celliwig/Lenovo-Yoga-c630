    ath10k: Add support to provide higher range mem chunks in wmi init command
    
    With the current implementation of wmi init command,
    there is no provision for the host driver to provide mem
    chunks addresses with more than 32-bit, to the firmware.
    WCN3990 is a 35-bit target and can accept mem chunks addresses
    which are above 32-bit.
    
    If firmware supports address range more than 32 bit, it
    advertises the support by setting the WMI_SERVICE_EXTEND_ADDRESS
    service. Based on this service fill the upper bits of paddr while
    providing the mem chunks in the wmi init command.
    
    Tested HW: WCN3990
    Tested FW: WLAN.HL.3.1-00784-QCAHLSWMTPLZ-1
