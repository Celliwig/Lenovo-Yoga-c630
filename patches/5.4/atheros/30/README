    ath10k: add support for hardware rfkill
    
    When hardware rfkill is enabled in the firmware it will report the
    capability via using WMI_TLV_SYS_CAP_INFO_RFKILL bit in the WMI_SERVICE_READY
    event to the host. ath10k will check the capability, and if it is enabled then
    ath10k will set the GPIO information to firmware using WMI_PDEV_SET_PARAM. When
    the firmware detects hardware rfkill is enabled by the user, it will report it
    via WMI_RFKILL_STATE_CHANGE_EVENTID. Once ath10k receives the event it will
    send wmi command WMI_PDEV_SET_PARAM to the firmware to enable/disable the radio
    and also notifies cfg80211.
    
    We can't power off the device when rfkill is enabled, as otherwise the
    firmware would not be able to detect GPIO changes and report them to the
    host. So when rfkill is enabled, we need to keep the firmware running.
    
    Tested with QCA6174 PCI with firmware
    WLAN.RM.4.4.1-00109-QCARMSWPZ-1.
