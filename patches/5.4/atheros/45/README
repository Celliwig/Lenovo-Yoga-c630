    ath10k: qmi: Sleep for a while before assigning MSA memory
    
    Unless we sleep for a while before transitioning the MSA memory to WLAN
    the MPSS.AT.4.0.c2-01184-SDM845_GEN_PACK-1 firmware triggers a security
    violation fairly reliably. Unforutnately recovering from this failure
    always results in the entire system freezing.
