    ath10k: snoc: skip regulator operations
    
    The regulator operations is trying to set a voltage to a fixed value, by
    giving some wiggle room. But some board designs specifies regulator
    voltages outside this limited range. One such example is the Lenovo Yoga
    C630, with vdd-3.3-ch0 in particular specified at 3.1V.
    
    But consumers with fixed voltage requirements should just rely on the
    board configuration to provide the power at the required level, so this
    code should be removed.
