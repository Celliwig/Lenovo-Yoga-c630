    ath10k: change max RX bundle size from 8 to 32 for sdio
    
    The max bundle size support by firmware is 32, change it from 8 to 32
    will help performance. This results in significant performance
    improvement on RX path.
    
    The real max rx bundle is decided in ath10k_htc_wait_target(),
    it is the min value of HTC_HOST_MAX_MSG_PER_RX_BUNDLE and the value reported
    from firmware. So this change shouldn't cause any regressions with other
    hardware supported by ath10k.
    
    Tested with QCA6174 SDIO with firmware WLAN.RMH.4.4.1-00017-QCARMSWPZ-1.
