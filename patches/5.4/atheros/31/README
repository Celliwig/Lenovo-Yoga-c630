    ath10k: enable transmit data ack RSSI for QCA9884
    
    For all data packets transmitted, host gets htt tx completion event. Some QCA9984
    firmware releases support WMI_SERVICE_TX_DATA_ACK_RSSI, which gives data
    ack rssi values to host through htt event of data tx completion. Data ack rssi
    values are valid if A0 bit is set in HTT rx message. So enable the feature also
    for QCA9884.
    
    Tested HW: QCA9984
    Tested FW: 10.4-3.9.0.2-00044
