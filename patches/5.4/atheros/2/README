    ath10k: Fix HOST capability QMI incompatibility
    
    The introduction of 768ec4c012ac ("ath10k: update HOST capability QMI
    message") served the purpose of supporting the new and extended HOST
    capability QMI message.
    
    But while the new message adds a slew of optional members it changes the
    data type of the "daemon_support" member, which means that older
    versions of the firmware will fail to decode the incoming request
    message.
    
    There is no way to detect this breakage from Linux and there's no way to
    recover from sending the wrong message (i.e. we can't just try one
    format and then fallback to the other), so a quirk is introduced in
    DeviceTree to indicate to the driver that the firmware requires the 8bit
    version of this message.
