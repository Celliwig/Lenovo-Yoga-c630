    ath10k: avoid leaving .bss_info_changed prematurely
    
    ath10k_bss_info_changed() handles various events from the upper layers. It
    parses the changed bitfield and then configures the driver/firmware
    accordingly. Each detected event is handled in a separate scope which is
    independent of each other - but in the same function.
    
    The commit f279294e9ee2 ("ath10k: add support for configuring management
    packet rate") changed this behavior by returning from this function
    prematurely when some precondition was not fulfilled. All new event
    handlers added after the BSS_CHANGED_BASIC_RATES event handler would then
    also be skipped.
