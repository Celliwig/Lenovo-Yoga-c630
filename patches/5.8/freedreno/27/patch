Subject: [PATCH] iommu/arm-smmu: Don't bypass pinned stream mappings

Commit 0e764a01015d ("iommu/arm-smmu: Allow client devices to select
direct mapping") sets the initial domain type to SMMU_DOMAIN_IDENTITY
for devices that select direct mapping. This ends up setting the domain
as ARM_SMMU_DOMAIN_BYPASS which causes the stream ID mappings
for the device to be programmed to S2CR_TYPE_BYPASS.

This causes a problem for stream mappings that are inherited from
the bootloader since rewriting the stream to BYPASS will disrupt the
display controller access to DDR.

This is an extension to ("iommu/arm-smmu: Allow inheriting stream mapping
from bootloader") [1] that identifies streams that are already configured
 and marked them as pinned. This patch extends that to not re-write pinned
stream mappings for ARM_SMMU_DOMAIN_BYPASS domains.
