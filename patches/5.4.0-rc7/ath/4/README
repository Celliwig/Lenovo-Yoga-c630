    ath10k: Use standard regulator bulk API in snoc
    
    The regulator_get_optional() exists for cases where the driver needs do
    behave differently depending on some regulator supply being present or
    not, as we don't use this we can use the standard regulator_get() and
    rely on its handling of unspecified regulators.
    
    While the driver currently doesn't specify any loads the regulator
    framework was updated last year to only account for load of enabled
    regulators, so should the need appear it's better to apply load numbers
    during initialization that dynamically.
    
    With this the regulator wrappers have been reduced the become identical
    to the standard bulk API provided by the regulator framework, so use
    these instead of rolling our own.
