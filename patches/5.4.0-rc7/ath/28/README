    ath10k: fix offchannel tx failure when no ath10k_mac_tx_frm_has_freq
    
    Offchannel management frames were failing:
    
    [18099.253732] ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: timed out waiting for offchannel skb cf0e3780
    [18102.293686] ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: timed out waiting for offchannel skb cf0e3780

    [18114.453726] ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: timed out waiting for offchannel skb cf0e3f00
    [18117.493773] ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: timed out waiting for offchannel skb cf0e36c0
    [18120.533631] ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: timed out waiting for offchannel skb cf0e3f00
    
    This bug appears to have been added between 4.0 (which works for us),
    and 4.4, which does not work.
    
    I think this is because the tx-offchannel logic gets in a loop when
    ath10k_mac_tx_frm_has_freq(ar) is false, so pkt is never actually
    sent to the firmware for transmit.
    
    This patch fixes the problem on 4.9 for me, and now HS20 clients
    can work again with my firmware.
