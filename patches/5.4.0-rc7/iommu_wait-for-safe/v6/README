Subject	[PATCHv6 0/3] QCOM smmu-500 wait-for-safe handling for sdm845
Date	Tue, 17 Sep 2019 15:15:01 +0530
	

Previous version of the patches are at [1]:

QCOM's implementation of smmu-500 on sdm845 adds a hardware logic called
wait-for-safe. This logic helps in meeting the invalidation requirements
from 'real-time clients', such as display and camera. This wait-for-safe
logic ensures that the invalidations happen after getting an ack from these
devices.
In this patch-series we are disabling this wait-for-safe logic from the
arm-smmu driver's probe as with this enabled the hardware tries to
throttle invalidations from 'non-real-time clients', such as USB and UFS.

For detailed information please refer to patch [3/4] in this series.
I have included the device tree patch too in this series for someone who
would like to test out this. Here's a branch [2] that gets display on MTP
SDM845 device.

This patch series is inspired from downstream work to handle under-performance
issues on real-time clients on sdm845. In downstream we add separate page table
ops to handle TLB maintenance and toggle wait-for-safe in tlb_sync call so that
achieve required performance for display and camera [3, 4].

Changes since v5:
 * Addressed Robin's comments and removed unwanted header file.

Changes since v4:
 * Addressed Stephen's comments.
 * Moved QCOM specific implementation to arm-smmu-qcom.c as per Robin's suggestion.

Changes since v3:
 * Based on arm-smmu implementation cleanup series [5] by Robin Murphy which is
   already merged in Will's tree [6].
 * Implemented the sdm845 specific reset hook which does arm_smmu_device_reset()
   followed by making SCM call to disable the wait-for-safe logic.
 * Removed depedency for SCM call on any dt flag. We invariably try to disable
   the wait-for-safe logic on sdm845. The platforms such as mtp845, and db845
   that implement handlers for this particular SCM call should be able disable
   wait-for-safe logic.
   Other platforms such as cheza don't enable the wait-for-safe logic at all
   from their bootloaders. So there's no need to disable the same.
 * No change in SCM call patches 1 & 2.

Changes since v2:
 * Dropped the patch to add atomic io_read/write scm API.
 * Removed support for any separate page table ops to handle wait-for-safe.
   Currently just disabling this wait-for-safe logic from arm_smmu_device_probe()
   to achieve performance on USB/UFS on sdm845.
 * Added a device tree patch to add smmu option for fw-implemented support
   for SCM call to take care of SAFE toggling.

Changes since v1:
 * Addressed Will and Robin's comments:
    - Dropped the patch[4] that forked out __arm_smmu_tlb_inv_range_nosync(),
      and __arm_smmu_tlb_sync().
    - Cleaned up the errata patch further to use downstream polling mechanism
      for tlb sync.
 * No change in SCM call patches - patches 1 to 3.
