just ideas that might, or might not work.

- Resizing of root partition
- Flashing an image over USB using dfu-util
- Menu system to group systems by SoC to scale list as device support grows
- Support for tegrarcm to write out uboot for tegra devices over USB
- Duplicating a currently running system from a SD card to an onboard eMMC
- Dynamic list of devices supported based on available u-boot firmwares and/or known means of writing out SoC options
- Support writing images with hosts that support uEFI
- Support writing u-boot to NAND devices like C.H.I.P.
